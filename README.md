Symfony bundle which provides OAuth 2.0 authorization/resource server capabilities. The authorization and resource server actors are implemented using the [thephpleague/oauth2-server](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server) library.

## Important notes

This bundle provides the "glue" between  [thephpleague/oauth2-server](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server) library and Symfony.
It implements [thephpleague/oauth2-server](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server) library in a way specified by its official documentation.
For implementation into Symfony project, please see [bundle documentation](docs/basic-setup.md) and official [Symfony security documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/security.html).

## Status

This package is currently in the active development.

## Features

* API endpoint for client authorization and token issuing
* Configurable client and token persistance (includes [Doctrine](https://www.doctrine-project.org/) support)
* Integration with Symfony's [Security](https://symfony.com/doc/current/security.html) layer

## Requirements

* [PHP 7.2](http://php.net/releases/7_2_0.php) or greater
* [Symfony 4](https://symfony.com/4) or [Symfony 3.4](https://symfony.com/roadmap/3.4)

## Installation

1. Require the bundle with Composer:

    ```sh
    composer require trikoder/oauth2-bundle --no-plugins --no-scripts
    ```
    
    > **NOTE:** Due to required pre-configuration, this bundle is currently not compatible with [Symfony Flex](https://github.com/symfony/flex).

2. Create the bundle configuration file under `config/packages/trikoder_oauth2.yaml`. Here is a reference configuration file:

    ```yaml
    trikoder_oauth2:

        authorization_server:

            # Full path to the private key file.
            # How to generate a private key: https://oauth2.thephpleague.com/installation/#generating-public-and-private-keys
            private_key:    # Required, Example: /var/oauth/private.key

            # The string used as an encryption key.
            # How to generate an encryption key: https://oauth2.thephpleague.com/installation/#string-password
            encryption_key:    # Required

            # How long the issued access token should be valid for.
            # The value should be a valid interval: http://php.net/manual/en/dateinterval.construct.php#refsect1-dateinterval.construct-parameters
            access_token_ttl: PT1H

            # How long the issued refresh token should be valid for.
            # The value should be a valid interval: http://php.net/manual/en/dateinterval.construct.php#refsect1-dateinterval.construct-parameters
            refresh_token_ttl: P1M

        resource_server:

            # Full path to the public key file
            # How to generate a public key: https://oauth2.thephpleague.com/installation/#generating-public-and-private-keys
            public_key:    # Required, Example: /var/oauth/public.key

        # Scopes that you wish to utilize in your application.
        # This should be a simple array of strings.
        scopes: []

        # Configures different persistence methods that can be used by the bundle for saving client and token data.
        # Only one persistence method can be configured at a time.
        persistence:

            doctrine:

                # Name of the entity manager that you wish to use for managing clients and tokens.
                entity_manager: default # Required
             
            in_memory: ~
    ```

3. Enable the bundle in `config/bundles.php` by adding it to the array:

    ```php
    Trikoder\Bundle\OAuth2Bundle\TrikoderOAuth2Bundle::class => ['all' => true]
    ```

4. Update the database so bundle entities can be persisted using Doctrine:

    ```sh
    bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force
    ```

5. Import the routes inside your `config/routes.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    oauth2:
        resource: '@TrikoderOAuth2Bundle/Resources/config/routes.xml'
   ```

You can verify that everything is working by issuing a `GET` request to the `/token` endpoint.

## Configuration

* [Controlling token scopes](docs/controlling-token-scopes.md)
* [Password grant handling](docs/password-grant-handling.md)
