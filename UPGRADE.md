# Upgrade
Here you will find upgrade steps between releases.

## From 3.2.0 to 4.0.0

### Remove `exception_event_listener_priority`
The bundle configuration `exception_event_listener_priority` has been removed in favor of [Event](docs/event-data-customization.md).

### Error response are now formatted in json by default
All the error response are now formatted as json (no formatting before).

They can be modified using the new event system.

All the errors follow the same structure :
```json
{
    "message": "<error message>"
}
```


## From 3.1.1 to 3.2.0

The bundle makes modifications to the existing schema. You will need to run the Doctrine schema update process to sync the changes:

```

The schema changes include:

* Added on delete `CASCADE` on authorization code entity client association


## From 3.1.0 to 3.1.1

The schema changes include:

* Removed the `userIdentifier` index from `oauth2_access_token` and `oauth2_authorization_code` tables

## ~~From 3.0 to 3.1.0~~

> **NOTE:** This is now obsolete due to issue [#196](https://github.com/trikoder/oauth2-bundle/issues/196). You can safely ignore it.

## From 1.x to 2.x

### PSR-7/17 HTTP transport implementation

The bundle removed a direct dependency on the [zendframework/zend-diactoros](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros) package. You now need to explicitly install a PSR 7/17 implementation. We recommand that you use [nyholm/psr7](https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7). Check out this [document](https://github.com/trikoder/oauth2-bundle/blob/v2.0.0/docs/psr-implementation-switching.md) if you wish to use a different implementation.

### Scope resolving changes

Previously [documented](https://github.com/trikoder/oauth2-bundle/blob/v1.1.0/docs/controlling-token-scopes.md) client scope inheriting and restricting is now the new default behavior. You can safely remove the listener from your project.

### SQL schema changes

The bundle adds new tables and constraints to the existing schema. You will need to run the Doctrine schema update process to sync the changes:

```sh
bin/console doctrine:schema:update
```

* `access_token` field on the `oauth2_refresh_token` table is now nullable
